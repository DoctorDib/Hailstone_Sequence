# Hailstone_Sequence

A small recursive program which takes in user input, and spits out an array (including a reverse copy) sequence of the steps it took to reach to one.

# Rules:
 - If number equals 1, then terminate the program.
 - If number is even, then 'n / 2'.
 - If number is odd, then '(3 * n) + 1'.
